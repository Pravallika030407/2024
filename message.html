        <p>Happy 2024 Baby~~~~....It was a beautiful year with you. You know I love sending these lil messages and letters to my loved ones..Thank you for being with me every time. I'm very scared of entering into 2024 bc I'm supposed to get a job, get settled n do everything that we should do but I'm not sure whether I will be able to do any of those things. I feel like I'm not yet completely grown up to do them. I don't have a dream or goal right now. It's just that I've to work hard n do my part. I'm very much confident in doin' anything bc I have you, only u supporting me. Thank you for that tanzi... I would be nothing without you. I really wish I'm a boy bc I would've married you this instant.(But unlucky I'm not ..ERRRR !!!) I'm dead serious. In your next life you be the same n I'll be born as a handsome boy, will find you n let's run off together somewhere farrrr !!!...Anyways It's a new yr...keep smiling just like this and enjoy each and every moment Tanzi. I will always be here with you. LOVE YOU MORE THAN LOVE</p>
